# AI- Computer Vision

AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a broad field of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Two prominent subfields within AI are NLP (Natural Language Processing) and CV (Computer Vision).



CV (Computer Vision):


Computer Vision is a branch of AI that aims to enable machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves extracting meaningful information from images or videos to make sense of the visual content. Computer Vision finds applications in image and video analysis, object recognition, image generation, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and more.
Key tasks and techniques in Computer Vision include:

Image Classification: Assigning a label to an image from a predefined set of categories.
Object Detection: Identifying and localizing multiple objects in an image.
Image Segmentation: Dividing an image into meaningful regions to understand its structure.
Image Generation: Creating new images using AI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Converting text in images into machine-readable text.
Pose Estimation: Estimating the position and orientation of objects or humans in images or videos.
